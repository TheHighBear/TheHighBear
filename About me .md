- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheHighBear
- 👀 I’m interested in IT, computers, video games, music and sound, VR, Fitness, Languages, Freelancing, Photography, Photo manipulation, mental health and psychology as well as Tech in general and tinkering with stuff and trying to figure stuff out.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to manage my frustration and mental wellbeing while focusing on my goals one step at a time as life goes on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project which falls into any of my interest.
- 📫 How to reach me: currently here is the only place you can reach me as I'm uncomfortable providing other social media accounts at this time.
